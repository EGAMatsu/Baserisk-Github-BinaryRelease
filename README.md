# Baserisk-Github-BinaryRelease
Baserisk client, removed all old data, this is begining to move away from the Quake 1 source port engine to its own.

Please report issues in the Issues tab so i can fix engine side issues and such!

Please for the love of jesus do NOT download the respo (aka clone it), go to releases and get the latest there, thats where to most up to date builds will be.
